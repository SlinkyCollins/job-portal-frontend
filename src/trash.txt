Perfect bro, you’re **actually deeper into the project** than you think — your foundation is solid.

Now it’s time to **lock in, simplify what’s left, and beast your way to MVP**.

---

### 🔥 PROJECT STATUS (Right Now)

#### ✅ Frontend:

* **Homepage** — Done
* **Login Page** — Done
* **Signup Page** — Done
* **Remaining Frontend Tasks:**

  * Dashboard UI (User dashboard) — Done
  * Dashboard UI (Employer dashboard) — 
  * Job Listings page (view all jobs) — Done
  * Job Details page (when user clicks on a job) — Done
  * Apply to Job page/modal - Done

#### ✅ Backend:

* **Signup** — Done
* **Login** — Done
* **Dashboard** — In Progress
* **Remaining Backend Tasks:**

  * Add Job (for testing) — or later via DB - Done
  * Get All Jobs - Done
  * Get Job by ID - Done
  * Apply to Job endpoint - Done
  * (Optional: User can view applied jobs later)



## 🏁 REFINED GOAL: MVP Roadmap (Realistic + Beast Mode)

Here’s what we’re focusing on ONLY:

> 🔹 User can sign up/login
> 🔹 User sees jobs
> 🔹 User clicks job to view details
> 🔹 User applies to job
> ✅ Boom. JobNet MVP complete.

---

## 🐺 3-DAY BEAST MODE PLAN

### **DAY 1: Finish the Frontend**

* ✅ Touch up login/signup if needed
* ✅ Build **User Dashboard** UI — simple welcome, job listings, logout btn
* ✅ Build **Job Listings Page** — show jobs in card format 
* ✅ Build **Job Details Page** — open a specific job on click
* 🔲 Add **Apply button/modal or form**
* 💡 Use dummy JSON at first if backend is not connected yet

> Goal: Have a fully clickable **frontend flow** using dummy data.

---

### **DAY 2: Backend MVP**

* ✅ Complete Dashboard logic if it’s user-specific
* ✅ **Add Job** manually to DB or a seed file (or skip adding jobs for now)
* ✅ Create API: `/jobs` → return all jobs
* ✅ Create API: `/jobs/:id` → return single job
* ✅ Create API: `/apply` → accept user & job info, store it (no need to send email or notify for now)

> Goal: Backend fully supports frontend — even with dummy DB

---

### **DAY 3: Connect Frontend + Backend**

* ✅ Hook up frontend to real API

  * Axios or Fetch to get jobs, view job, and apply
* ✅ Test the full flow:

  * Sign up → log in → dashboard → view jobs → apply
* 🔲 Clean up UI if time allows (just small polish)
* 🔲 Prepare for a README or case study doc

---

## ⚡ After MVP:

You can now add:

* Admin dashboard
* Job posting from UI
* User can view applied jobs
* Pagination, search, filters, and all that extra drip

---

## 🎯 Reminder: You're Not Behind

You’ve already passed the **hardest part** (getting started and sticking with it).

Now you’re in the **execution and wrapping up phase** — it’s time to be sharp, fast, and focused.
