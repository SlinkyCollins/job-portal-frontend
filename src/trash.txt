## 🐺 3-DAY BEAST MODE PLAN

### **DAY 1: Finish the Frontend**

* ✅ Touch up login/signup if needed
* 🔲 Build **User Dashboard** UI — simple welcome, job listings, logout btn
* 🔲 Build **Job Listings Page** — show jobs in card format 
* 🔲 Build **Job Details Page** — open a specific job on click
* 🔲 Add **Apply button/modal or form**
* 💡 Use dummy JSON at first if backend is not connected yet

> Goal: Have a fully clickable **frontend flow** using dummy data.

---

### **DAY 2: Backend MVP**

* 🔲 Complete Dashboard logic if it’s user-specific
* 🔲 **Add Job** manually to DB or a seed file (or skip adding jobs for now)
* 🔲 Create API: `/jobs` → return all jobs
* 🔲 Create API: `/jobs/:id` → return single job
* 🔲 Create API: `/apply` → accept user & job info, store it (no need to send email or notify for now)

> Goal: Backend fully supports frontend — even with dummy DB

---

### **DAY 3: Connect Frontend + Backend**

* 🔲 Hook up frontend to real API

  * Axios or Fetch to get jobs, view job, and apply
* 🔲 Test the full flow:

  * Sign up → log in → dashboard → view jobs → apply
* 🔲 Clean up UI if time allows (just small polish)
* 🔲 Prepare for a README or case study doc

---

## ⚡ After MVP:

You can now add:

* Admin dashboard
* Job posting from UI
* User can view applied jobs
* Pagination, search, filters, and all that extra drip

---

## 🎯 Reminder: You're Not Behind

You’ve already passed the **hardest part** (getting started and sticking with it).

Now you’re in the **execution and wrapping up phase** — it’s time to be sharp, fast, and focused.

Want me to help you break down **Day 1's tasks into tiny chunks** so you know what to do today, hour by hour?
